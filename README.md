# Accelerated SGD Methods: ECE236C course project 2019 Spring

This is Zhiping Xiao (Patricia)'s course project's code. Here is [the final report](./ECE236C_Final_Report.pdf).

For PyTorch implementation I referred to the [official documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html) for help.

Borrowed the implementation of the negative curvature descent from [Jinghui Chen's code](https://github.com/uclaml/GOSE/blob/master/cnn_gose.py), and corrected its errors and glitches.

The CNN structure follows what is specified in [CS269 by Prof. Chih-Jen Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/courses/optdl2019/).
